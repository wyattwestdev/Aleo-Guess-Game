# Aleo-Guess-Game

A Guess Game built in Aleo, where an user tries to guess a constant number set by the program.

* The guess() function gets a guess number "n" from the user and returns:

    * -1 if n is lower than the number;
    * +1 if n is higher than the number;
    * 0 if n is equal to the number.
